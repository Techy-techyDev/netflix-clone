                The Netflix Kids experience is included in your membership to
                give parents control while kids enjoy family-friendly TV shows
                and movies in their own space. Kids profiles come with
                PIN-protected parental controls that let you restrict the
                maturity rating of content kids can watch and block specific
                titles you don’t want kids to see.
